                <h3>About Bryce</h3>
                <p>Since high school I have had an interest in coding and programming. I am excited to have finally taken the steps required to pursue out this great career. I want to design amazing products, help people get an end result they want, and an experience they enjoy. </p>
                <p>I enjoy being able to spend time with my family and doing board and card games with them, or whatever else kind of fun things we end up doing for an evening. I look forward to supporting them through programming.</p>
